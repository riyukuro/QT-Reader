# QT-Reader
WIP PySide6 QT LN/WN Reader: Currently Unusable.

# TODO:
- [ ] Caching for network calls (ie. Covers)
- [ ] Library Database
- [ ] Threaded cover loading
- [ ] Better data handling (Overall)
- [ ] Rework Source Functions (ie. Currently calling the fetch_novel_details also fetches chapters)
- [ ] Setup Source Repository
- [ ] Setup Downloading & Installing Sources from the repository
- [ ] Reader Settings (Background color, Text color, text size, text font, etc.)
- [ ] Download chapters (.html or .txt files more; maybe epubs later on)
- [x] ~~Add Top Bar (For search)~~
- [ ] Hideable side bar (Used for when in the reader; maybe automatic)
- [ ] Name for the reader (QT-Reader/LNReader won't be the name forever)

# Current goals for the project:
- Downloadable sources (Extensions)
- "Customizable" reader
